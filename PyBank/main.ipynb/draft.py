#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
                #Variables
                                  
TM = "Total Months" 
TP = "Total profits"
AC = "Average Change"
GIP = "Greatest Increase in Profits"
GDP = "Greatest Decrease in Profits"



#The total number of months included in the dataset.
#use len for months the company records. ie
#len (monthly_records - nomonthly_records)

#The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
#ie profit= inser data set 
#total = ()
#x= sum (total)

#The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
#import statictics 
#print(statistics.mean([]))

#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
#GIP= max ()
#print GIP

#The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
#GDP = min ()
#print GDP

#Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
#Financial Analysis
#----------------------------
print ("Total Months: " + TM)
print ("Total: " + T)
print ("Average Change: " + AC)
print ("Greatest Increase in Profits: " + GIP)
print ("Greatest Decrease in Profits: " + GDP)
#Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
